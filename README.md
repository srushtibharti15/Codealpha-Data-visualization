# Codealpha-Data-visualization
An end-to-end data visualization project which analyse student performance factor.This project utilizes automated reporting to uncover how variables like study hours, teacher quality, and motivation levels correlate with academic success, providing data-driven insights through an interactive dashboard.

Professional Context:
This project was developed as Task 3 during my internship at CodeAlpha. The objective was to move beyond basic reporting and create a strategic tool that identifies actionable patterns in student performance data to assist educational stakeholders.

Task Objectives:
Correlation Mapping: Identifying the statistical relationship between study hours and final exam outcomes.

Environmental Assessment: Evaluating the impact of external variables like teacher quality and internet access.

Behavioral Analysis: Quantifying the role of student motivation and parental involvement in academic success.

Interactive Intelligence: Building a user-centric interface for dynamic data filtering.

Technical Implementation
1. Data Engineering
Dataset: StudentPerformanceFactors.csv containing diverse academic and demographic parameters.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values (e.g., Teacher Quality) and standardized categorical variables for accurate visualization.

2. Analytical Logic
Advanced Metrics: Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) to track average scores and performance benchmarks.

Data Segmentation: Categorized students by motivation levels and socioeconomic factors to isolate performance drivers.

Key Analytical Findings:
Consistency vs. Results: A clear positive trend between study hours and higher scores, visualized through longitudinal analysis.

The Motivation Factor: High motivation levels consistently correlate with a significant percentage increase in average performance.

Resource Access: Analysis of how digital access (Internet) impacts the effectiveness of independent study hours.
